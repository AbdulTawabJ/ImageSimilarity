# About
Parallel Computing Semester Project. Image Similarity based on Local Binary Patterns. Two Way Implementation, MPI and OpenMP.
# Structure
1. The Program Takes in input images (input_images/)
2. Tests the target image against them (any image from test_images/) Prints Highest Similarity.
3. Uses Multi Programming. (MPIImageMatch.cpp)
4. Uses Multithreading. (OMPImageMatch.cpp)
